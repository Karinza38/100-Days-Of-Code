# The Git clone method
The git clone method works on any system including Linux. Just type the command given below and you have cloned it.
But my recommendation is that you should update your git and make sure it is installed and that it is working fine and perfectly then only you should clone it.
##
    git clone https://github.com/Arcron-ArchLinux/100-Days-Of-Code.git
After you have done cloning it type the command given below.
##
    cd 100-Days-Of-Code
Then you can customize it according to your wish.
# The Zip file method
The zip file method also works in any operating system including Linux, Mac, and Windows.
Just click on the code button and you should see a option called zip download.
After that, you should see a download bar on your browser or app.
When it is downloaded run the commands below
##
    unzip 100-Days-Of-Code.zip
##
    cd 100-Days-Of-Code
And that's it you are all ready to go!
